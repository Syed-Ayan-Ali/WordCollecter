## Project Description: WordCollector

**Overview:**
WordCollector is a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your vocabulary and streamline the process of documenting new words. Whenever you encounter a new word online, simply highlight it and click "Add word to Doc." The extension will fetch the word's definition and a relevant image, then automatically append this information to your Google Doc.

**Features:**
- **Context Menu Integration:** Easily add words directly from any webpage with a simple right-click.
- **Definition Retrieval:** Utilizes a Dictionary API to fetch accurate definitions for selected words.
- **Image Search:** Integrates with Unsplash to provide a visual representation of the word.
- **Google Docs Integration:** Seamlessly appends the word, definition, and image link to a specified Google Doc.
- **User Notifications:** Keeps you informed with notifications about successful additions or errors.

**Future Enhancements:**
In upcoming updates, the project will evolve to allow users to review and manage their collected words through a dedicated app, making vocabulary building even more interactive and accessible.

WordCollector is perfect for students, writers, and anyone looking to enrich their language skills effortlessly!
